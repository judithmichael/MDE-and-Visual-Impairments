# Model-to-Model Transformation

- S4 uses a UI \pim as input and provides adapted \pims as output which should serve different visual impairments, e.g., blindness, deafness, low vision. The second model-to-model transformation creates \psms depending on the platform, e.g., web, mobile, or desktop.
- S5 uses several model-to-model transformations: They transform an accessible UI model and an interaction platform model, e.g., for a smartphone or desktop application, to an accessible UI model adapted to a specific interaction platform. The latter is then transformed to a model for a specific execution platform. 
- S24 suggest model-to-model transformations from WebML models without accessibility requirements to other ones incorporating accessibility requirements such as for complex interface components but lacking a concrete implementation.
- S20 relies on several transformations, e.g., from a task model to a tailored task model, from abstract UIs to tailored abstract UIs and from concrete UIs to concrete UIs tailored for specific accessibility needs.
- S19 transforms a task model to an abstract UI model as well as the abstract UI model to an IMS Access For All Digital Resource Description Information Model based on ISO/ IEC24751 for describing digital learning resources.

The other four primary studies transform abstract UI models to PSMs. 
- S16 transform task and domain models to abstract UI models and then to concrete UI models based on the Cameleon reference framework. 
- S17 transforms an abstract UI description to platform-specific UI models.
- S28 relies on transformations from PIMs to PSMs.
- S27 transforms abstract UI models and context models to concrete UI models as well as abstract UI models to application interface models for the communication between the UI and other components of the application.
