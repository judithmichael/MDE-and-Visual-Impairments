# Open gaps and challenges from the accessibility and MDE perspective

| Number of Papers | Focus in research | Paper Keys |
|----------------------------|:--------:|:--------:|
|27  | Accessibility is the main research focus. MDE is the method used  |S1, S2, S4-S23, S26-S30   |
|3  | MDE is the main research focus. integrating accessibility in MDE |S3, S24, S25 |

Some details:
* S3 explicitly integrates accessibility concerns into the model-driven process of accessible mobile apps and discusses issues that can be automatically handled in the transformations. 
* S24 aims to improve the WebML modeling language to become capable of mapping \wcag guidelines to requirements and describes how \mde transformations are derived.
* S25 aims to develop modeling techniques for handling the non-functional, generic, and crosscutting characteristics of accessibility concerns.
